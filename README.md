# Review-Web-Scraping

Using Jupyter notebook to code in Python, I work with data from the Top 250 movies on IMDb (http://www.imdb.com/chart/top). I scrape the data from IMDb using a request, and collect the text I needed using Beautiful Soup. I parse the text into each individual movie and further into each piece of info by using regular expressions to find patterns. I collect this data into Pandas dataframe and then use Seaborn to plot out interesting information and draw conclusions.
